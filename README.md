# PowerBI-Project
This project was requested from the Bootcamp of Data Analytics. Me and my colleague had the chance to select any database and analyze in Python and PowerBI and present a Dashboard in PowerBI 

Our team was composed of Anna Syrigonaki and George Dimou that were both following the Bootcamp course of Big Blue Data Analytics. We found the dataset of Job salaries of Data related job titles for the years 2020-2022. This dataset was found in Kaggle. 

On this dataset we decided to create an interactive dashboard for the students of the Data Analytics course of our bootcamp that will be an Employment Guide for Europe and the Rest of the World. Also in this analysis we added valuable information for the ones who are reside in one European country (e.g. Greece) and they want to know what are the opportunities to work remotely 100% for companies in or out of Europe. 

For this project we had 4 hours and we had to present all the results in a single-page PowerBI report in 5 mins. 

For the analysis: 

We used Python to do a data cleaning and a preparation on the dataset:
Dropped NAs
Grouped the job titles from 50 to 4 (e.g. Data Science Specialist to Data Science)
Dropped the employment types of Part - Time and Freelancer since we wanted to analyze only the Full-Time jobs. 
Categorized in and out of Europe company location.

In the dashboard you can use the sliders to segment your search with the following filters:
Experience Level: Entry Level, Senior etc., 
Job Title. 


Visuals that shows the: 
Average Salary per Country by Job Title, 
the Salary variation between the years 2020 - 2022, 
Average Salary per Job Title by Company Location, 
Average Salary for remote roles abroad for people based in Greece and
the size of the companies with Data Science related roles in Europe and worldwide.
